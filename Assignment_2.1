#############How to read a heavy csv/tsv file using readr package?#########

# The easiest way to get readr is to install the whole tidyverse:
install.packages("tidyverse")

# Alternatively, install just readr:
install.packages("readr")

To accurately read a rectangular dataset with readr you combine two pieces: a function that parses the overall file, and a column specification.

Ex: mtcars <- read_csv(readr_example("mtcars.csv"))

readr supports seven file formats with seven read_ functions:

read_csv(): comma separated (CSV) files
read_tsv(): tab separated files
read_delim(): general delimited files
read_fwf(): fixed width files
read_table(): tabular files where colums are separated by white-space.
read_log(): web log files
